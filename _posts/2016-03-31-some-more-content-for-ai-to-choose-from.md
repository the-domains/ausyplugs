Some more content for AI to choose from!

So yesterday I made my firs post and it didn't really do muchgood.. I'll try to type somemoreto get more of a contentandimagery!

So yesterday I worked my back off on my plugs I feel like I'mgetting closer to it. In order tomake these plugs affordable Ineed to make whole lot of them so I could fire them at oncesince the electricity they get fired with is pretty expensiveandthe material is shrinkingdifferently in each firing I do my bestto make them as similar as possible and coastefficient.
