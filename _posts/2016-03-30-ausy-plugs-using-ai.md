Ausy Plugs using AI

Great! We're now on The Grid. I'm very exited to see how this is going to look eventually. We're still working hard to get our products out to the public, meanwhile setting up the site and starting to write some posts! Be patient my dear friends It's definitely worth our while! In just few more weeks you will get your hands on our plugs and fire up your flesh tunnels! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1de5b89d-fa96-48d2-8c97-3ce2f445b8a1.jpg)

Some more content for AI to choose from!

So yesterday I made my firs post and it didn't really do much good.. I'll try to type some more to get more of a content and imagery! 

So yesterday I worked my back off on my plugs I feel like I'm getting closer to it. In order to make these plugs affordable I need to make whole lot of them so I could fire them at once since the electricity they get fired with is pretty expensive and the material is shrinking differently in each firing I do my best to make them as similar as possible and coast efficient. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1299878d-4d33-48c5-bbed-d49475b4227a.jpg)
